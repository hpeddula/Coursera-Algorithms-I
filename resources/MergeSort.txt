First call to Sort from the client is the one which calls the one which accepts only a single array.
sort(Comparable[] a) => this gets the array from the client.

This sort method creates an aux array and initializes it with the length of the array passed into the function.

Values passed to the second sort method sort(Comparable[] a,Comparable[] aux,int hi,int lo).

Private Sort gets invoked for the first time with sort(a,aux,0,15).

The private sort calculates the mid value based on the lo and hi values,so mid = 0+(15-0)/2 =7.
